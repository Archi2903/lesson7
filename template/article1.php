    <p class="display-4"> Bitcoin fell by more than 10% after the tweet, while Tesla shares also dipped.</p>

    Tesla's announcement in March that it would accept the cryptocurrency was met
    with an outcry from some
    environmentalists and investors.

    The electric carmaker had in February revealed it had bought $1.5bn (Â£1bn) of
    the world's biggest digital currency.

    Elon Musk's SpaceX to launch dogecoin moon mission
    Bitcoin could derail China's climate change targets
    How Bitcoin's vast energy use could burst its bubble
    But on Thursday, it backtracked on its previous comments.

    "We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin
    mining and transactions,
    especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel," Mr Musk wrote.

    "Cryptocurrency is a good idea... but this cannot come at great cost to the
    environment."

    He also said the electric carmaker would not sell any of its Bitcoin,
    and intends to use
    it for transactions as soon as mining shifts to using more
    sustainable energy.</p>

<p class="col-sm-10">Market analysts see the move as an attempt by Tesla to assuage
    the concerns of investors who are focused
    on climate change and sustainability.

    "Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) issues are now
    a major motivation for many investors.
    Tesla, being a clean energy-focused company, might want to work better
    in the environmental area of ESG,
    " Julia Lee from Burman Invest told the BBC.

    "But a cynic might suggest that this is just another move by Elon Musk
    to influence the cryptocurrency market,
    as he has done on so many other occasions," she added.</p>
